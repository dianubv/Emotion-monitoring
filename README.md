# Emotion Monitoring
A mix of main projects from my last year of engineering studies.

# Emotion Recognition
This is a deep learning algorithm that detects emotions by heart rate signals. 
**It's not working for now**
The code is adapted from [this code](https://github.com/joergsimon/SSL-ECG-Paper-Reimplementaton/tree/main) from [joergsimon ](https://github.com/joergsimon). 

# Psychological advice text generator 
The project is based on the nanoGPT project from Karparthy (https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). You can find all the code [here](https://github.com/dianubv/psychology_chatbot).
